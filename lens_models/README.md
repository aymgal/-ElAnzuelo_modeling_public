# Lens models of _El Anzuelo_

This directory contains lens models described under the [COOLEST](https://github.com/aymgal/COOLEST) standard.

These are as follows:
- **Cluster + Shear** ([coolest-elanzuelo-herculens-Cluster+Shear](coolest-elanzuelo-herculens-Cluster+Shear)): the fiducial model presented in the paper;
- **Cluster + Shear (300x300)** ([coolest-elanzuelo-herculens-Cluster+Shear_(300x300)](coolest-elanzuelo-herculens-Cluster+Shear_(300x300))): similar as the fiducial model but with tripled source resolution (300 x 300 pixels).

The notebook [load_coolest_model.ipynb](load_coolest_model.ipynb) shows how to load the models under using the `coolest` interface and explore their content.
