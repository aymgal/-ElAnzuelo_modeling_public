# Strong lensing analysis of _El Anzuelo_ observed with JWST 

Mass distribution and surface brightness models of the strong lens system _El Anzuelo_ from [Galan et al. 2024a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18636). The mass model of the host cluster (_El Gordo_) is taken from [Caminha et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02718).

The content of this repository is as follows:

- [lens_models](lens_models): lens models described under the [COOLEST](https://github.com/aymgal/COOLEST) standard.
